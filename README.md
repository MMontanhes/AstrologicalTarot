# AstrologicalTarot
Page that provides a simple but complete tool for shuffling and drawing tarot cards.

Hello friends, this site was developed with some main motivations:
allow online tarot consultation using the card selection method;
provide a serene and distraction-free environment;
make available the digital version of the deck I use.

I share some information and reflections on the card drawing system developed here.

It basically consists of scrambling by the computer,
and the choice of letter(s) by the consultant, among the 78 existing ones.
Computational randomness is only applied to scrambling. Once arranged,
the cards keep the same position until they are shuffled again or the page is reloaded.

I know that many are suspicious of the idea of ​​consulting the tarot and other oracles through
of programs/internet, for several reasons. I think the essential thing is the messages, all of them,
and not just one or the other, at one time or another.

So I see no reason to fear any experience. Everything is the way it has to be.
There is no knowledge without there being ignorance. There is no wrong without there being right - they coexist
and they are one thing. When we highlight something, its opposite/complementary is highlighted in the same proportion
to maintain proportionality.

It doesn't matter the method used when we are aware, knowing
that any oracle is just what we call reality.

Greetings, Marcos.
